# Introduction

## Creators

- Robert Griesemar
- Rob Pike
- Ken Thompson

## Why a new language?

Based on creators experience with Java, Python, and C/C++

- slow compile times
- threading is patched in to the language and is challenging to develop and maintain
- complex type system

## Go Features

- Strong and statically typed makes it more reliable and robust.
- Excellent Community and Documentation
- Simplicity, there is almost only a single way to do stuff.
- Fast compile times
- Garbage-collected
- Built-in concurrency
- Compiles to a standalone binary

## Cons
- Simplicity means less abstractions means more development time.
- Young language
  - library support is not as huge as other languages.
  - tooling needs maturity e.g. GOPATH and GO modules
